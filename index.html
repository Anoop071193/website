                while pointing out its strong resemblance to Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo.[13] Writing for GameSpy, William Abner praised the game as "elegantly designed" and singled out the charm and personality of the game's graphics and pet animations.

                It was a runner-up for their list of the year's top 10 computer games.Fate was also a finalist for PC Gamer US's "Best Roleplaying Game 2005" and "Best Value 2005" awards, which ultimately went to Dungeon Siege II and Guild Wars, respectively.</p1>
